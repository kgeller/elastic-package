The Bitwarden integration allows you to stream logs from the Bitwarden password management service into the Elastic Stack. Bitwarden is a popular open-source password manager that helps individuals and organizations securely store and manage passwords and other sensitive information. With this integration, you can ingest Bitwarden logs into Elasticsearch, enabling you to search, analyze, and visualize the log data using Kibana. This can be useful for monitoring user activity, detecting potential security threats, and ensuring compliance with security policies. For example, you can create dashboards to track failed login attempts, password changes, or access to specific vaults or items. The integration provides a pre-built data stream and pipeline to automatically parse and enrich the log data.
